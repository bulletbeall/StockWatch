# StockWatch

|Goal|
The end goal of this project is to be able to scrawl through websites of stock analysts and create a "fake" portfolio. It will have The ability to store, buy, sell, and order short sale and stop losses. Once a stock has been deemed a good buy by multiple analysts, the stock will be purchased, held, put a percentage based stop loss on, and watched through scrawling hourly. If the stock ever enters a SELL phase it will be sold and profits/losses will be kept track of.

|Current Capabilities|
websiteScrubber.py will srub marketwatch to get the latest analyst changes, sort them by number of analysts, deletes any stock not watched by at least 10 analysts,
and store them in a file.

|In Dev|
Use marketwatch.com as source of buy/overweight/hold/underweight/sell
All of it.
